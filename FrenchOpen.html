            <ul>
                <li class="lifrenchhistory">In 1891 the first French national championships were held in the Stade
                    Français, as a men’s
                    interclub competition. In 1897 women’s singles matches were added to tournament play. Women’s
                    doubles matches were added in 1925, the same year that the championships were opened to non-French
                    players. In 1968 the tournament was opened to professional as well as amateur players, as were a
                    number of the most established championships. Play moved in 1928 to the Stade Roland-Garros, which
                    contains clay courts. The French Open is generally held in late May–early June.

        <ul class="ulfrench1">
            <li>Roland Garros is famously known as the only Grand Slam tournament to be played on clay courts. </li>
            <li> ut the irony is that, the courts are not really made of clay. The court is composed of layers of
                sand, volcanic rocks topped with three inches of white limestone and red brick dust which gives the
                courts “THE CLAY EFFECT”.</li>
            <li>Roy Emerson has the most doubles titles with six and Martina Navratilova has the most for women with
                seven. </li>
